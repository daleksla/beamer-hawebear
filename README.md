# beamer-hawebear
## README

A crude, custom theme for LaTeX Beamer presentations.

This is a modification of the [My Dark Beamer Template for Lehigh University](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/my-dark-beamer-template-for-lehigh-university/jgwzhmcgvxnh) template, where I basically swapped brown for black, and gold for dark grey. 

I doubt I'll add more features - I've just made it broody for my own use
